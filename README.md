# CS 290 Final Project
Final Project for Jacob Dugan and Alex Edwards.

Prototype for an ordering/queueing system.
Choose and place an order on the homepage,
See and clear the queue in the queue page.

The queue page in an actual implementation is most likely to be gated by authentication credentials.
